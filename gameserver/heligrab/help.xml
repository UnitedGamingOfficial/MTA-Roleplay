<help>
This is a resource allowing you to jump, grab and hang onto parts of helicopters

The button/command to do this may be different on each server
The defaults are:
/grab or pressing your jump key to grab
/drop or pressing your backspace key to drop

If the server you are on is using commands you can bind these to keys yourself with:
/bind key state command (eg: "/bind lshift down grab")
