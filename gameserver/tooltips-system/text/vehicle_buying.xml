	<title>Buying a Vehicle</title>
	<text>To buy a vehicle head over to one of the cardealers we have in this city. They have every vehicle you could ever imagine, all brand new. If they're a bit too expensive for you, you could place an ad for a second hand car. It might not be the right colour you want and it might not have that fresh off the production line smell but atleast it's cheaper. For special vehicles, you can request those at the forums.
