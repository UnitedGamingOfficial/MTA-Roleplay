	<title>Getting Weapons</title>
	<text>Getting weapons won't be easy in the city of Los Santos, but they are definitely out there and available to the people with the right contacts. The only way you will get your hands on a good weapons dealer is if you roleplay well and meet the right people. You could however apply for a weapon's license through the LSPD but you'll need a good reason and spotless criminal record, they don't get handed out to just anyone. You could however buy yourself a golf club or a baseball bat and just store it in your car, afterall... it's only for protection right?
