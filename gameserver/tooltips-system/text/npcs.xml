	<title>Non-Playable Characters</title>
	<text>Throughout the city you will find NPCs (non-playable characters). Some NPCs are just for show while others perform functions within the server. To interact with NPCs press M to enble the cursor and right-click on the NPC. The NPC's menu will appear displaying their name and interaction options. You must interact with NPCs as if they were other players. That means you cannot start punching/kicking/shooting them without any IC reason.</text>
