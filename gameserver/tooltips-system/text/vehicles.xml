Vehicle Types

Civilain cars
Civilian cars are all the unowned cars you will find unlocked parked in car parks around the city. They are free to be used by anyone but in many cases are used for a particualr job available from city hall.
	
Personal Cars
Personal cars are bought from the Grotti car dealership in Rodeo and are owned by a specific player. When you purchase a personal car you will be given a key which you can use to lock the doors to prevent anyone else from using the vehicle. The car is always on the server so be sure to lock the doors when you are not using it or it might be stolen while you are offline. The owner of a personal car can also use /park to change where their car will respawn.
	
Faction Vehicles
These vehicles are only accessable to drive to members of the faction they belong to. The only factions with faction vehicles are the Police Department, Emergency Services and San Andreas Network. All other factions will have to buy and use personal cars.
