	<title>Buying and Renting Houses</title>
	<text>They say a man's home is his castle so after all that hard work and saving it must be time for you to purchase your very own house.
	
	Across the map are over 100 houses available for players to buy with more being added constantly. When a House is available to buy you will find a green house icon at it's entrance.
	
	If you stand near the icon you will be shown the houses address (every building has an address) and it's value.
	
	If you have enough to buy the house all you need to do is press the F or return key (the same button you use to enter a vehicle) on your keyboard. The green icon will change to a white arrow showing the house is now owned. When you go near the arrow the owners name is shown. Please remember that the owners name is OOC information and should not be used In Character.
	
	When you purchase a house you will be given a key that you can use to lock and unlock the front door. To use the key press K when standing at the door or open you inventory by pressing the I key, click on the 'House Key' item and click the 'Use Item' button. If you are standing near the entrance or inside the house a message will be shown in the chatbox saying the house has been locked or unlocked.
	
	Don't forget to throw a house warming party to get to know the neighbours.
