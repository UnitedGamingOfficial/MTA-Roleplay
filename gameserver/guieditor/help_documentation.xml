		<option name="Extra" description="This brings up an experimental sub-menu giving further options for creating GUI elements within GUI elements (for example, creating a button within a button).\n\nRemember that any GUI created this way may need manual tweaking once the code has been output (most commonly, re-ordering the GUI creation) to avoid errors."/>

		<option name="Element Alignment" description="GUI elements can be aligned with each other through the use of the Left and Right Control (Ctrl) keys.\n\nHold Ctrl and click on a GUI element to select it. While still holding ctrl, click on other GUI elements to align them with it.\n\nLeft ctrl will align horizontally and Right ctrl vertically, left and right click will align to the left/right side and the top/bottom respectively. You can only align GUI elements that share the same parent."/>
		<option name="Element Divider" description="Accessed by scrolling the mouse wheel while moving an element, this allows you to divide the parent of that element into sections which you can then snap the element you are moving onto.\n\nFor example: create a button inside a window, move the button and scroll up once. This will divide the window into 2 sections, allowing you to easily snap your button to the centre of the window.\n\nScrolling up again will divide the window into 3 sections, then 4, then 5 and so on. Scrolling back down to 1 section will remove the divider."/>
		<option name="Relative Positioning" description="Relative values can be between 0 and 1. They represent a value as a percentage of the parent.\n\nFor example, making a GUI element 0.5 in width means the width will be 50% of the parents width, regardless of what size the parent is. Making the x position 0.1 means the GUI element will be positioned 10% of the way across its parent.\n\nThis can be useful if you want your GUI element to always take up the same area of the screen independant of resolution (stretch).\n\nIts also helpful for resizing lots of elements together. It is however tricky to manually update values in relative format."/>
		<option name="Absolute Positioning" description="Absolute values are represented in pixels offset from the origin (top left) of the parent.\n\nFor example, making a GUI element 50 in width means it will always be 50 pixels wide, regardless of resolution (ie: wont stretch). Making the x position 10 means the GUI element will be positioned 10 pixels in from the left edge of the parent.\n\nThis can be useful if you want your GUI element size and position to remain constant across resolutions. It is also easy to update and maintain."/>
		<option name="Multiple selection" description="You can select multiple GUI elements at a time by clicking and holding the middle mouse button, then dragging the box around the GUI elements.\n\nA GUI element will only be &quot;captured&quot; if its top-left corner is within the highlighted area. You can then perform basic functions on all the elements together.\n\nLeft click on the screen or select &quot;Cancel&quot; to cancel."/>
		<option name="Get/Set Property" description="This can be used to Get or Set specific CEGUI properties on GUI elements. These properties open up many more possibilities than are available through pre existing GUI functions. For the property to be set the format of the value passed to it must be exactly correct, if the description does not indicate what this format should be you can use &quot;Get Property&quot; on the property to find out. Some of the widgets are not present in MTA, some are also named differently (eg: StaticText - Label) so finding the correct information may take some experimentation. The widgets and their properties are read from &quot;cegui_widgets.xml&quot; and &quot;cegui_property_descriptions.xml&quot; in the GUI Editor package."/>
		<option name="Loose Manipulation" description="Holding down shift while moving/resizing a GUI element will toggle Loose Manipulation on. This means that the gui editor will stop enforcing parent border integrity, allowing you to move and size your element outside the bounds of its parent."/>
		<option name="Parent" description="The &quot;Parent&quot; right click menu option allows you to manipulate the direct parent of the selected GUI element, even if the parent is not visible behind its child(ren)"/>
		<option name="DX Drawing" description="The DX functions allow you to draw rudimentary shapes, images and text onto the screen. They offer more control than the GUI counterparts but are much more difficult to implement and maintain. Be aware that they are NOT GUI elements, nor can they be parented with or have any link with other GUI elements. They exist separately from the GUI and separately from each other. They can be accessed through the &quot;Drawing&quot; option on the main right click menu."/>
		<option name="Share" description="Share allows you to share your GUI with other players on the server.\n\nBy selecting their name and clicking 'Share', a copy of your GUI is created and saved for the other player to view at any time.\n\nIf you make some changes and want to share those as well, select the player and click 'Share' again to update the saved GUI that they can see.\n\nIf you want to view someone elses GUI, once they have shared it with you simply select their name and click 'View'. Their GUI will then be loaded onto your screen.\n\nNote: the player list highlight colours only work in MTA version 1.0.4 and above."/>
		<option name="Create Scrollpane" description="Click, hold and drag your mouse pointer to create a scrollpane. Unfortunately these cannot be fully supported by the GUI Editor, so are largely placeholders for the convenience of visual placement/movement."/>
		<option name="Create Scrollbar" description="Click, hold and drag your mouse pointer to create a scrollbar. Unfortunately these cannot be fully supported by the GUI Editor, so are largely placeholders for the convenience of visual placement/movement."/>
		<!--<option name="Relative/Absolute Comparison" description="Both buttons are created within a 100x100 label. The first button is using Relative values, it is 0.1 (10%) from the edge of its parent and 0.4 (40%) in width. The second button is using Absolue values, it is 10 pixels from the edge of its parent and 40 pixels in width. By default the GUIEditor uses Absolute values for all elements created directly onto the screen, and Relative values for all elements that are children of another GUI element. This can be changed with the &quot;Rel/Abs Screen&quot; and &quot;Rel/Abs Child&quot; options."/> -->
