					[[Have you ever been ROBBED or CONCERNED about your current property? Did something FRUSTRATING or INCONVIENT happen on your PROPERTY? Need some extra POWER over your items? Maybe your department is lacking NESSISCARY EQUIPMENT ? 
					
					Adept Security Systems provides a solution to your problems regarding burglaries, legal issues, self protection, and Law Enforcement assistance equipment.
					
					Our cameras can be used for evidence in a court of San Andreas, or used to identify a wanted person for the crime of Burgulary. There's a wide variety of what they can be used for. 
					
					Objective: Adept Security Systems is a small organization specialized in installing security cameras, linking the cameras to send live and recorded feed to a database, which then is sent over a secured network to the desired option to display video from the security cameras. We've been established in Los Santos since 2010. Cavaro Security Systems recently moved to Los Santos after facing a spikeout in Northern California. We are strong willed, passionate about our business, appreciate and enjoy the trading we do with paying customers.]],
