		Commands in Roleplay!

There is many commands in the server but here is a select few that will help your roleplay!

/Me - One of the most used commands in the server. A /Me is used to describe what sort of action character is performing. Some examples would be... 

/me reaches behind his back, digging into his back pocket and finds his keys.
/me reaches towards his waist, pulling up his saggy pants.
/me slowly reaches for his knee, scratching it roughly.

Its always good to use description in your /me commands!
An understandable /Me is a good /Me!

It can also be used to describe yourself in third person like mentioned above and adds 's after your name. Use your imagination!
