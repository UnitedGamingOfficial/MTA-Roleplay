* All the files in this script have been encoded in ANSI and since we want to protect the scripts from stealers,
* I have decided to pre-compile all the files included in the root directory of the script. I have also provided
* you with a backup-copy of uncompiled AND compiled versions in their own directories within the root directory.
* Please use the compiled files when using the script on the server. I would not like people to steal my scripts.
